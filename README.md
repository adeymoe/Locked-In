## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, EJS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Calendar.js, Node.js, Express, Passport.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, MVC paradigm


I often plan my day with a list of tasks that I need or want to accomplish, but I realized I wasn't always finishing that list. To stay on track, I decided to build a personal to-do list application that could be reorganized and saved to a MongoDB database. I integrated a Pomodoro timer into the app, which helps me stay on schedule by playing a soft one-second alarm when the time expires. Additionally, I implemented a feature that allows events to be added to a calendar for better task management. To ensure secure access, I used Passport.js to allow users to sign into their accounts securely with an authenticated hash parameter.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

A flashcard section will be added to help you take note. A section yopu can go back to for reference purpose, with will also include inplementation of Artificial Intelligence to help with genration of the flash card randomly on your screen to help with ACTIVE RECALL of things you have learnt over time. It will be a pain to spend hours learning then going ahead to forget the bits and bobs.
